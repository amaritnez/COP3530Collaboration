# COP3530Collaboration
Collaboration of my COP3530 (Data Structures and Algorithms) assignments. All code can be found under the src folder.

HW1 is a simple queue that is implemented via a linked list. The linked list is a custom class refered to as DynamicNode. The queue takes in chars from a text file and arranges them based on the order that they are read. Duplicates are placed back to the rear of the queue. Note that the assignment requires multiple queues to be managed at once.

HW2 uses heapsort to find the specified smallest values in a pre-defined array

Lab1 converts an input string of characters that are in infix to prefix notation

Lab2 is Java Swing GUI that displays a chess board of queens that follow the following rule: 
1. Queens can not be in the same row, column, or diagonal position of any other queen on the board.
2. Every row of the board must be filled with a queen
3. The board is an 8x8 square
The logic of determining valid positions is calculated using recursion

Lab3 is basic dynamic list implementations and functionality

Lab4 is basic binary search tree implementation using pre-defined input
